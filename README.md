React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces in web applications. It employs a component-based architecture, uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates, and follows a declarative syntax. React's popularity stems from its ability to create reusable UI components and manage application state effectively, making it a key tool for building dynamic and responsive web interfaces.</i></h4><br>
